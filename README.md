- Firstly, user can choose either vegetable or fruit to guess
- According to the user choice, the program will generate random a vegetable or a fruit.
- User can guess the word as letters one by one.
- if letters correct, the programe shows the it's position. Otherwise, the Program shows how many guesses user has.
- if user guess the word, user can win the game.
